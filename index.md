## About
Open Data Day Cambridge is part of the global [Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) celebration and exploration of Open Data.

You're invited to come explore open data sets in a casual and friendly environment. Specifically, this event is intended to be a welcoming space to learn something new, and learn together. It's why we're coming:
- Yo is a software developer who knows Java best but has never used Python. So she's coming to give that a go for the first time.
- Naomi is definitely not a developer but loves data. She wants to make her first Jupyter notebook.

We hope you will join us and have fun exploring data.

**You bring**

- Your own laptop
- Your own objective for the day
- A sense of fun and adventure

**We supply**

- A space to work in
- WiFi
- Lunch
- Open data
- A friendly atmosphere

## Setting your objectives

### What do you want to learn?

Are you looking to visualise some data with Javascript, analyse data with Python, write a blog about some data insights using a Jupyter notebook, or something else?

### What do you care about?

Define a question you care about answering, and see if the data to answer it is open.

### What help might you need on the day?

We can't guarantee we can find you the help, but we will be supportive and help to crowdsource an answer where possible.

## Which data?
- [Open Data Day.org](http://opendataday.org/#resources) has some open research data you can use
- [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) has government-related public data sets, including some APIs
- An extensive **open** [listing](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) of open data sets
- This [Forbes article](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) from 2016 lists some too
- You can also bring your own, so long as it's open!

### Examples
What can be done with open data?

- Understand the patterns of local cyclists, like @betatim's [analysis of cyclists in Zurich](https://github.com/wildtreetech/explore-open-data) - try it yourself by launching the Binder!
- There are a lot of [ideas pending](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Research-doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Apostponed) from last year's Open Data Do-athon, London
- A [thread of cool things](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-apps-built-on-top-of-open-government-data?share=1) done with open data in the past
- Getting started: [data.world](https://docs.data.world/introdatasets/) has some starter data exercises
<!--- Work out which bins are collected when, like [this app](http://imactivate.com/leedsbins/) by @thomasforth *probably not achievable in a day!*-->
